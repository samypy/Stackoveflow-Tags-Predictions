Readership Dashboard:
Mayank's significant contribution to the Readership Dashboard revamp stands out. Collaborating closely with Shoeb, he created Mockups and coordinated with the Tech team, resulting in the successful launch of the revamped version on 8th May 2023. The updated Dashboard now features an additional contact level view, multiple filters for in-depth analysis, and remarkable performance improvements compared to its previous version. The positive feedback and appreciations received during the Mock run and post-going live affirm the Dashboard's success.

Corporate Access:
a) Corporate Access Leader Board:
In Q2, upon Suresh Pillai's request, Mayank developed the Corporate Access Leader Board to facilitate analyzing Corporate Access with Covered companies. The report proved instrumental in assessing covering analysts' performance and received high praise from Lucy, Suresh, Mike, Satyam, Niraj, and other Regional Managers. The inclusion of Top 25 Client-wise consumption further enhanced its utility.
