Cross Training:
a) Team:
As part of the team's goals to bridge knowledge gaps, Mayank initiated Training Sessions for the Readership Team. The first session on Emails & Parent Child took place on 26 April 2023, followed by a session on Readership Dashboard in May 2023. The feedback received from the team was overwhelmingly positive, with managers also appreciating the initiative.

b) Individuals:
Mayank took proactive steps to enhance individual expertise within the team. He appointed Mervin D. as Subject Matter Expert (SME) for Corporate Access, enabling him to manage reports independently and handle queries proficiently. Similarly, Mayank designated Devanshu as SME for Priority Contact Report. Furthermore, he provided valuable support to team members in resolving day-to-day queries related to Readership or Cognos, promoting a culture of continuous learning and skill development.

Productivity:
Mayank has been actively driving productivity improvements within the team. He is awaiting additional resources to assist in automating the Priority Contact Report, which will streamline the reporting process. Additionally, he is working on obtaining approval from Shoeb to prioritize the Vendor Channel Consumption Pack with the Tech team, further enhancing productivity.

Data Quality & Standardization:
Mayank demonstrated a keen eye for data quality and standardization. He successfully identified and resolved issues related to Un-attributed Reads caused by a Refinitiv vendor error. By rectifying the problem on 21st April 2023, over 115k+ reads were correctly attributed to their respective documents. Additionally, Mayank's thorough investigation revealed missing Video Reads and Akamai reads, resulting in an additional 45k reads being reported. He continues to be vigilant in maintaining data quality by promptly raising and tracking issues in the Tech Issue Tracker.

Mayank's efforts in driving cross-training, productivity, and data quality initiatives have significantly contributed to the team's success and efficiency. His dedication to individual growth and data accuracy further reinforces his valuable role within the Readership Team.
