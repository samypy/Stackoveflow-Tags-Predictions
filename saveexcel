In my self-performance evaluation, I actively contributed to our team's efforts in generating and executing eight productivity ideas across various MIG functions. Specifically, I made significant progress in automating manual tasks within the reporting domain. This automation not only saved our team a substantial amount of time but also streamlined our processes. I focused on improving broker votes by automating crowdsource adjustments and enhancing communication with the sales team, alleviating the team's workload.

Moreover, I collaborated closely with the Data Quality group to ensure that all our MIG reports adhered to the approved standard MIG guidelines. This entailed conducting training sessions to introduce the team to the new MIS style guide, ensuring that each member comprehended and effectively implemented the guidelines. Aligning our reporting practices with the approved guidelines led to improved report consistency and accuracy.

Furthermore, I worked in collaboration with Shoeb and Mangesh to gain a deep understanding of the process for creating interaction reports. We identified opportunities for efficiency improvements, including adding additional summaries to existing reports and conducting simulations to optimize the timely delivery of relevant summaries to regional BUMS within the first five days of the month. Rigorous data quality checks were implemented to minimize errors in the report.

I successfully facilitated cross-training across various MIG functions:

1. **Product Scores:** I oversaw the cross-training of Shraddha and Srikant on product scores, and Shraddha has been producing error-free product scores for the past three months.

2. **Research Connect Stats:** I collaborated with the Research Connect team to meet new requirements for RC stats and ensured Akshat fully understood the report, enabling him to produce it on a monthly basis.

3. **Quarterly MIS Report:** Together with Mayank, I initiated cross-training for Shraddha and Srikant on Quarterly MIS reports, with a target of full transition by December 2023.

4. **Client Interactions Feeds:** I ensured that we met client deadlines with high data quality, working closely with vendors and Corporate Access teams to troubleshoot any discrepancies. This led to the timely and accurate provision of events data to our clients. Additionally, I actively pursued the finalization of the CorpAxe contract with Chris Dyas, which would allow us to leverage existing capabilities for more frequent data transfers.

5. **Broker Votes:** I collaborated with Akhilesh to reallocate resources during high-demand situations, particularly when delivering the Advisory Index report to management on short notice. Working with Gayatri, we automated the time-consuming crowd-sourcing process, and I plan to further evaluate the process for potential reengineering and additional automation.

6. **Properties Interactions Reports:** I closely collaborated with Sanyoja and Devanshu to ensure the error-free production of interaction reports. We also successfully automated the labor-intensive crystal ball report, enabling us to consistently deliver reports on time.

In conclusion, my performance over the specified period reflects a dedicated commitment to enhancing the efficiency and quality of our team's work in various MIG functions. By working collaboratively and driving process improvements, we were able to generate and implement eight productivity ideas, automate manual tasks, and ensure adherence to standardized reporting guidelines. This not only resulted in significant time savings but also improved the consistency and accuracy of our reports.

Through cross-training initiatives, we expanded the skills and capabilities of team members, enabling them to take on new responsibilities with confidence and accuracy. These efforts have culminated in tangible achievements, such as error-free product scores, timely report production, and improved client interactions.

In the future, I am eager to continue pursuing process enhancements and automation opportunities, as well as working closely with my colleagues to further streamline our operations. I remain committed to contributing to the success of our team and the achievement of our goals.
