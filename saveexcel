Hello Chris, I hope everything is going well. Can you provide any updates on the status of the CorpAxe agreement? Right now, the team is manually uploading events into CorpAxe every 6 hours, which occasionally leads to problems. For instance, coordinators may make changes to event participants or mark events as confidential, and these changes are only reflected in CorpAxe after the next manual upload. We already have a system in place that can send SFPT feeds to CorpAxe every 1 hour, which would eliminate the need for manual uploads. Please advise if you have any concerns about us starting to send the forward calendar feed via STFP, or if you prefer that we wait until the agreement is finalized.
