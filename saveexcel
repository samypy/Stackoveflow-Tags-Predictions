Aniket's dedication to minimizing manual efforts and driving automation has been commendable, leading to significant improvements in report preparation.

1. Product Scores:
Aniket created a feed that runs daily, retrieving Focus List data along with additions and deletions. This automation not only saves time but also ensures accuracy, streamlining the report preparation process.

2. Research Connect Stats:
Aniket tackled the challenge of making judgmental calls in bifurcating report buckets. To simplify this process, he developed a template that identifies errors in the file. After removing errors, running the macro generates the required summary data, which can be easily copied into the report file.

3. Corporate Access Report:
To enhance efficiency, Aniket created a macro that retrieves all reports with a single click. He further automated the manual task of generating the Global Stats report requested by stakeholders, streamlining the reporting process.

4. Internal MIS Feed:
Aniket implemented a daily feed that consolidates all data runs within a day. Previously, the team had to manually collate 30/31 days' data into a single file, a time-consuming task. To overcome this, Aniket added a macro to the feed that automatically collates data for a month and restarts the process for the next month, saving valuable time and effort.

Aniket's proactive approach has significantly improved report preparation, but he is not stopping there. He aims to automate other critical reports by the end of the year, further enhancing efficiency and productivity within the team.
